# Problem: Maximum K Elements Sum
# Description:
# Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, the goal is to maximize the sum by performing
# the following operation `k` times: 
# 1. Remove the maximum element from the list.
# 2. Add that element to the total sum.
# 3. Replace the maximum element with its ceiling of one-third (rounded up) value.
# The function returns the total sum after performing `k` operations.

# Time Complexity: O(k * log n), where `n` is the length of the input list and `k` is the number of operations.
#                  Each heap operation (pop and push) takes O(log n).
# Space Complexity: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list due to the heap storage.

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.maxKelements([10, 20, 7], 3))  # Expected output: 37
