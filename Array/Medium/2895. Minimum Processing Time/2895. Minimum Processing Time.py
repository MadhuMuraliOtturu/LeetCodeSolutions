# Problem: Minimize Maximum Processing Time
# Description: Given a list of processing times for servers and a list of task processing times,
#              find the minimum possible time required to process all tasks on the servers.

## Time Complexity: O(N log N + M log M), where N is the number of servers and M is the number of tasks.
## Space Complexity: O(1), as we are sorting the input in place and using constant extra space.

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.minProcessingTime([8, 10], [5, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1]))  # Example output: 17
