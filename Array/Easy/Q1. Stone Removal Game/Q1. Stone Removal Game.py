# Problem: Can Alice Win?
# Description:
# Alice and Bob play a game where they start with `n` stones. Alice removes the first 10 stones,
# then 9, 8, and so on, alternating turns with Bob. The player unable to make a valid move loses.
# Determine if Alice can win if both players play optimally.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 20
# Output: False
# Explanation: Bob will win since the last move leaves Alice with no valid stones to remove.
#
# Constraints:
# - 1 <= n <= 10^9

# Time Complexity: O(âˆšn) - Stones are reduced in a decreasing sequence.
# Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage.
