# Problem: Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Start to Goal
# Description: Given two integers `start` and `goal`, find the minimum number of bit flips required
# to convert `start` to `goal`. A bit flip changes a '0' to a '1' or vice versa.

    def minBitFlips(self, start, goal):
        """
        Computes the minimum number of bit flips to convert `start` to `goal`.

        :param start: Integer, the starting integer.
        :param goal: Integer, the target integer.
        :return: Integer, the minimum number of bit flips.
        """
        flip = bin(start ^ goal)
        return flip.count('1')

## Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of bits in the binary representation of the integers.
## Space Complexity: O(1), constant space used.

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.minBitFlips(10, 7))  
# Expected output: 3, since converting 1010 (10 in binary) to 0111 (7 in binary) requires 3 flips.
