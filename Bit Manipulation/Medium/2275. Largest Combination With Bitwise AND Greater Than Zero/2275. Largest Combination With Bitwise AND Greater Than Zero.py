# Problem: Largest Combination of Bitwise AND > 0
# Description:
# Given a list of integers `candidates`, find the size of the largest subset of numbers 
# in `candidates` such that the bitwise AND of the subset's elements is greater than zero. 
# Each element in `candidates` is represented in binary form, and the task is to identify 
# the bit position with the maximum number of '1's across all elements.
#
# Example:
# Input: candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum number of '1's at a bit position among all numbers is 4, so the answer is 4.
#
# Constraints:
# - `1 <= candidates.length <= 10^5`
# - `1 <= candidates[i] <= 10^7`
