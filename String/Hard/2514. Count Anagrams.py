# Problem: Count Total Anagrams in a Sentence
# Description: Given a string `s` containing words separated by spaces, count how many distinct anagrams 
# can be formed from the letters of each word and return the product of the counts of anagrams for all words, modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Time Complexity: O(N * K), where N is the number of words in the string and K is the average length of a word.
## Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the size of the largest word's frequency count.

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.countAnagrams("eat tea ate"))  # Expected to return the product of the number of anagrams for each word
